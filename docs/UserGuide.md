LibTask is a **desktop application for librarians to manage book loans and requests by patrons, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your book tracking tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# 1. Introduction

As a school librarian of a large library, you may already have your own desktop library software. However, existing library softwares are GUI-based and slow to work with. If you prefer to work with CLI commands efficiently while still having the benefits of aesthetic displays, then LibTask is designed just for you! LibTask provides you with a well packaged system of commands for managing book loans and book requests by your patrons. Using LibTask, you can quickly process borrowing and returning books, and view different groups of patrons and books to perform tasks such as notifying patrons with overdue books. The system also maintains two independent lists of books and patrons, allowing you to perform queries more efficiently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Quick start

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your LibTask.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
